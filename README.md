# ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es

> A universal NFT metadata and rendering API.

ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es returns an NFT's metadata in a consistent, universal format, as well as domain-specific rendering logic in order to render arbitrary NFTs.

ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es is a work-in-progress, and was written for [ðŸ“¦ drop.nifti.es](https://drop.nifti.es).

## Usage

`GET https://use.nifti.es/api/:id`

where `:id` is a [ChainAgnostic CAIP-19](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md) identifier that follows the [CAIP-22](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-22.md) standard for ERC721 assets and a yet-specified (but very similar) CAIP-XX standard for ERC1155 assets.

```json
{
  "render": {
    "type": "image",
    "src": "https://themanymatts.lol/images/bagel.png",
    "alt": "bagel matt â€” matt's joy is your joy. grab a bagel and enjoi."
  },
  "metadata": {
    "name": "bagel matt",
    "description": "matt's joy is your joy. grab a bagel and enjoi.",
    "decimals": 2,
    "image": "https://themanymatts.lol/images/bagel.png"
  }
}
```

## Get Asset Metadata
