# ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es

> A universal NFT metadata and rendering API.

ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es returns an NFT's metadata in a consistent, universal format, as well as domain-specific rendering logic in order to render arbitrary NFTs. It's like [Noembed](https://noembed.com/) but for digital assets.

ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es is a work-in-progress, and was written for [ðŸ“¦ drop.nifti.es](https://drop.nifti.es).

## Usage

First, refer to your asset or collection using a [ChainAgnostic CAIP-19](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md) identifier that follows the [CAIP-22](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-22.md) standard for ERC721 assets and a yet-specified (but very similar) CAIP-XX standard for ERC1155 assets.

It looks something like `eip155:1/erc1155:0x28959Cf125ccB051E70711D0924a62FB28EAF186/0`.

Then, fetch consistent metadata like so:

`GET https://use.nifti.es/api/:id`

```json
{
  "render": {
    "type": "image",
    "src": "https://themanymatts.lol/images/bagel.png",
    "alt": "bagel matt â€” matt's joy is your joy. grab a bagel and enjoi.",
    "sources": [{ "src": "https://themanymatts.lol/images/bagel.png" }]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "name": "bagel matt",
    "description": "matt's joy is your joy. grab a bagel and enjoi.",
    "decimals": 2,
    "image": "https://themanymatts.lol/images/bagel.png"
  }
}
```

You can also **view** an arbitrary asset like:

```
https://use.nifti.es/eip155:1/erc1155:0x28959Cf125ccB051E70711D0924a62FB28EAF186/0
```

(this might be useful if you want to show a user a full detail page, but without rendering the entire thing yourself)

## CAIP-19 References

You can refer to a **collection** with an id like `eip155:1/erc1155:0x28959Cf125ccB051E70711D0924a62FB28EAF186`.

You can refer to an **asset** with an id like `eip155:1/erc1155:0x28959Cf125ccB051E70711D0924a62FB28EAF186/0`.

Check out [CAIP-19](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md) and [CAIP-22](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-22.md) for more specifics, but it's basically `chainId/assetStandard:contractAddress/tokenId`.

If you'd like to see support for more Ethereum-compatible networks, as well as other chains supported by CAIP addressing formats, please submit a PR to propose an integration.

ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es currently supports the following render types:

- `empty` (i.e. no metadata available)
- `image`
- `animated` (i.e. gifs)
- `oembed` (i.e. any embedded media like youtube, vimeo, and other sites supported on [noembed.com](https://noembed.com/))
- `video`
- `model` 3D models in gltf / glb formats
- ðŸ”œ `plaintext` and other textual media types

see [common/types/Render.ts](common/types/Render.ts) for specifics

ðŸ–¼ use.nifti.es supports well-known standards on Ethereum mainnet, namely:

- CryptoPunks
- CryptoKitties
- ERC721
- ERC1155
- ðŸ”œ ERC20
- ðŸ”œ Hashmasks (ostensibly supports ERC721, but does not support metadata standard)

If you'd like to see support for another contract standard, please submit a PR to propose an integration.
